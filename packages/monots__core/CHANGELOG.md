### Minor Changes

- [`23e7a89`](https://github.com/monots/monots/commit/23e7a893bcaebe5896aa65cdd2860e3b56021305) Thanks [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr)! - Support fully nested routes for entrypoints. For example you can now add `common/file/origin.ts` to your entrypoint and it can be consumed with `<PACKAGE_NAME>/common/file/origin` by end users. This was not possible before.
